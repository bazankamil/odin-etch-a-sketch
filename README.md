-CSS and HTML manipulations in JS

## Description

The program creates a grid created from "divs" which change color when hovered over.
-You can create pixelart
-Change color
-Use an eraser to remove unwanted blocks
-Change the size of the workspace

#### For my work I used only the help of mozilla documentation

Have fun!
